# Transparent Dark Gray

## A transparent dark gray theme for Home Assistant 
> This is my first ever custom theme for Home Assistant and my first ever GitHub/HACS repository.<br /> 
Thanks to:Â https://github.com/JOHLC/transparentblue for his dark blue theme, where this theme is based on.

## General information
I am using the frontend extion [animated backgrounds](https://github.com/Villhellm/lovelace-animated-background). Thats the reason that I have removed a background from this theme. <br /> 
If you want one, please have a look below under Changing the background image. Maybe I will release a darkgray version with a background implemented.
As I am using this for my personal interest. Be aware, that I will only be giving limited support and wont accept all pull requests.

## Button Colors
### transparentgray-other.yaml
If you prefer the Gray and Blue buttons (second screenshots), change the code as below:<br /> 
  #Switches<br /> 
  switch-checked-button-color: ''                                           #Switch On<br /> 
  switch-unchecked-button-color: 'var(--slightly-darker-text)'              #Switch Off<br /> 
  switch-checked-track-color: '#009FFF'                                     #Switch background when On<br /> 
  switch-unchecked-track-color: '#767682'                                   #Switch background when Off<br /> <br />

"LAB" stands for "Lovelace Animated Background".

### Manual Installation - not recommended<br />
