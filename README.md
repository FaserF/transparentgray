# Transparent Dark Gray

## A transparent dark gray theme for Home Assistant 
> This is my first ever custom theme for Home Assistant and my first ever GitHub/HACS repository.<br /> 
Thanks to:Â https://github.com/JOHLC/transparentblue for his dark blue theme, where this theme is based on.

## General information
I am using [this](https://github.com/Villhellm/lovelace-animated-background) with animated backgrounds. Thats the reason that I have removed a background from this theme. <br /> 
If you want one, please have a look below under Changing the background image. Maybe I will release a darkgray version with a background implemented.
As I am using this for my personal interest. Be aware, that I will only be giving limited support and wont accept all pull requests.
